# ml-price-suggestion

Code for my university individual project to utilise NLP and ML techniques to suggest prices for items sold online.
Currently under development. Two working models can be found inside the models folder, namely Bag_of_Words_Random_Forest and Word_Embeddings_Random_Forest.
Most of the functionalities is inside the lib folder, mainly the code that deals with language processing.
